# FastFood_App
I. What I wanted to learn and achieve with this project
As a result of an Udemy course that offered as challenge to create an application in order to manager the process of selling hamburgers I wanted to create a program that would combine and use all the Java-OOP pillars (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism) that I got familiar with.
This application is able to select types of burgers and some of the additional items (additions) that are added to the burgers and pricing. I created a base Hamburger (Class), with two other types of hamburgers.
The Hamburger (Class) has the following items.
•	Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc.) that the customer can select to be added to the burger. (Each one of these items gets charged an additional price in order to calculate the final price (base burger with all the additions).

Two extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses):
a) HealthyBurger (Class) plus two addition items that can be added.
•	The Healthy Burger has 6 items (Additions) in total.
b) DeluxeBurger - comes with chips and drinks as additions. 
•	No extra additions are allowed.
All 3 classes have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger plus all the additions, each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the burger (base price + all additions).
